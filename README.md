# Pay It Forward Contract ðŸ’µ

I've been interested in a few protocols like AAVE and Uniswap lately. How they use ERC20 & ERC721 tokens 
to represent provided liquidity. Previously I have written up a simple contract called the [Pay It Forward contract](https://github.com/GandalfsDad/optimism-test-deployment), 
which allows a person to deposit (and receive) some funds which are passed to the next depositor.

As a learning exercise to improve my solidity skills I'm hoping to expand this to be a multi contract project that has tokens tracking the give/take's of individual users.
